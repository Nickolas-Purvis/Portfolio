            <h1>My Experience</h1>

                <div class="Experience">
                As far as my experience goes, I've dabbled only a little into the technological world. I first started taking computer science related classes around seventh and eigth grade where I began with the basics, learning how to type properly and simple coding. I can't recall what specific classes I took but I believe I took three or four computer science based classes.

                <br>
                Throughout highschool, myself along with the rest of the school have taken computer science classes. So far, I have learned Python and Java, but more recently I have learned about HTML and CSS from Ben.
                <br>
                <br>
                For my experience with the internship, I think it was really good for me to be a part of it. Ben was an amazing and patient instructor. He has handled the COVID-19 situation very well and I feel like I've still learned even though our class hasn't been together for roughly a month, give or take some time.
                <br>
                <br>
                When it comes to my future and what type of work I'd be interested getting into, I'd like to look more into topics such as graphic design and cybersecurity. These two subjects have peaked my interest over time.
